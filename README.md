# Simple_File_System

## Description
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with how an efficient file system works, while also practiing skills such as starting in a thorough design process, working in an Agile environment, and practicing the technical skills that I've learnt so far. 
I chose to pursue this project because the minimum viable product would be something that is achievable with the skills I already have, but the end product is so broad that I can expand and learn new concepts through application. As of right now, the end goal for this projecct is to make a simplified version of the Unix File System, that operates on an emulated disk. The skills I intend on focusing on in this project is to minimize fragmentation and make my code as efficient as possible.
